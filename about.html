     <h1> Once upon a time... </h1>
    <p>Longboarding South Africa began in January 2011 out of a passion for the sport of riding long skateboards, and in particular for riding them down hills – surfing the endless concrete wave, as the cliché goes. Back then, the sport was probably about one fifth of the size that it is now in 2014, and finding good-quality gear was not easy. All that was available to the average saffa were the pintail cruisers from some Cape Town surf stores. So if you didn’t live in Cape Town, chances are that you wouldn’t have known that the was such a thing as longboarding in South Africa at all!
    <br>
    <br>
    Longboarding SA began as an online forum where enthusiasts of the sport could find a place to discuss technique and equipment, to share local skate spots and sessions, and mainly just to share the general stoke of the sport. Being online, the forum had no bias towards any particular area or skill level – anyone with any level of stoke for the sport was welcome (and still is! Check out the forum here). The forum is still there and is accessible by anyone - it’s had its traffic highs and lows. Facebook is where most of the discussions are happening these days but  the benefit that the forum has over a Facebook group, however, is that discussions on the forum will always be there and will always be searchable. Once there are no more comments or 'likes' on a discussion on Facebook, the discussion will slip down the group wall until it's lost for eternity where only Mark Zukerberg will have access to it.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    Today, Longboarding SA has stayed true to those humble beginnings and financial gain is not something we're chasing too hard. We're more driven to support and maintain the longboarding community in South Africa by providing the essentials in longboarding equipment and promoting anything and everything through our blog and social media. We may not have every brand under the sun, although we did have the widest range available in SA at one time. Instead of focussing on stocking the latest and mosted hyped up products as soon as they are available we prefer to focus on giving our customers the best possible service at the lowest possible price. If there is something you're looking for that is not on our site, let us know and we'll either source it for you or let you know where to find it.
